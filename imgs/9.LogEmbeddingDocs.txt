Patterns in logs can be efficiently detected using Python's regular expressions. However, when dealing with massive log files containing millions of lines, identifying unique patterns becomes challenging. To address this, clustering techniques can be used.  

The approach involves processing an aggregated log file (e.g., in Excel format) and generating embeddings using a model like BERT Sentence Transformer (or any other suitable embedding model). These embeddings are then clustered using DBSCAN or another clustering algorithm.  

This is an unsupervised learning approach, meaning no target labels are provided. Unlike classification tasks where we assign predefined labels, here, we group log entries based on textual similarity. The goal is to identify patterns, groupings, or clusters within the raw log data.  

By applying DBSCAN, we can form meaningful clusters of log messages. Upon examining these clusters, we can extract representative text messages, which can then be used to build comprehensive regular expressions for pattern detection.  

Note: Log aggregation should be handled by the Data Engineering team.
