Pattern can be detected easily using the python regular expressions. The Question however is our logs might be huge you might have million lines in you logs how do you exactly know what type of unique patterns you have for that you can use clustering so we take this excel file which is an aggregated log and we generate embeddings using let say Bret sentence transformer you can use any embedding model then we can ues DB Scan or any other clustering algorithm to cluster all these logs.

So it's an unsupervised learning approach, we are not going to provide any Target label because we are not trying to classify thing into out target label.We are trying to classify thing as per the raw text do you see any patterns or any grouping or any clustering that' what we trying to classify so we'll use DB Scan Algorithm to form clusters of all our logs and these clusters when you examine them you will see the text message. Based on text message we can build all types of regular expression.



Note: Log Aggregation should be done by Data Team(Data Engineer)
